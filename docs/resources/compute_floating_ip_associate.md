# t1_compute_floating_ip_associate (Resource)

Associate a floating public IP to an instance.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "t1_compute_instance" "vm" {
  flavor = data.t1_compute_flavor.small
  image  = data.t1_compute_image.astra
  ssh_keys = [t1_compute_ssh_key.test.id]
  
  network_interface = {
    subnet_id = data.t1_vpc_network.default.subnets[0].id
  }
  system_volume = {
    size = 10
  }
}

resource "t1_vpc_public_ip" "foo" {
  region = "ru-central1"
}

resource "t1_compute_floating_ip_associate" "associate" {
  instance_id = t1_compute_instance.vm.id
  floating_ip = t1_vpc_public_ip.foo.floating_ip
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `floating_ip` (String) Dedicated floating IP address from created `public_ip` order, which will be associated with VM network interface. Changing this will dissociate current floating IP from instance network interface and associate another.
- `instance_id` (String) ID of the `instance` order , which network interface will be associated with floating IP address. Changing this will dissociate floating IP from current instance network interface and associate to another.
