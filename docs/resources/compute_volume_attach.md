# t1_compute_volume_attach (Resource)

Provides an T1.Cloud Volume Attachment as a top level resource, to attach and detach volumes from T1.Cloud Instances.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "t1_compute_instance" "vm" {
  flavor = data.t1_compute_flavor.small
  image  = data.t1_compute_image.astra
  ssh_keys = [t1_compute_ssh_key.test.id]
  
  network_interface = {
    subnet_id = data.t1_vpc_network.default.subnets[0].id
  }
  system_volume = {
    size = 10
  }
}

resource "t1_compute_volume" "attached" {
  zone      = "ru-central1-a"
  name      = "test-attachments"
  size      = 5
  disk_type = "Basic"
}

resource "t1_compute_volume_attach" "attachment_block_example" {
  instance_id  = t1_compute_instance.vm.id
  volume_id    = t1_compute_volume.attached.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `instance_id` (String) ID of the Instance to attach to.
- `volume_id` (String) ID of the Volume to be attached.

### Optional

- `skip_destroy` (Boolean) Use this flag if volume is attached to an instance, and will be deleted on instance termination. It's just remove the volume attachment from Terraform state.
